I propose an API that provides flood prediction data for a given location. 
Users will input the latitude and longitude of their area of interest, and the API will run a predictive model to assess the potential flooding effects in that region. 
With this, benefactors such as local government units, disaster response teams, urban planners, and residents in flood-prone areas 
can make informed decisions through data.
